# singly-linked-list
Implementation of the simple abstract data type, singly linked list.

- Singly linked list with the following functions:
  - addFirst(): add an element at the beginning of the list.
  - get(): get the element in the list at index i.
  - insert(): insert a given element at a given index i.
  - remove(): remove the element at a given index i.
  
- Uses a tail reference to make inserting at the end faster.

- Several executable test files for various tests on the data structure.
